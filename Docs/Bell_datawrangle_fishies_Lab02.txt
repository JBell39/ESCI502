2023 Processing Notes 
 
1. Transferred data from fishies_raw.xlsx to new file fishies_cleaned.xlsx
   1. Saved both files to project folder: Lab 02: Data Wrangling
2. Moved metadata from fishies_cleaned.xlsx into fishies_metadata.xlsx
   1. Then downloaded fishies_metadata as .txt file
   2. Saved to project folder: Lab 02: Data Wrangling
3. Moved pivot table from fishies_cleaned.xlsx into fishies_pivottable.xlsx
   1. Then copied pivot table, right clicked, pasted as values only (so not to lose data)
   2. Saved to project folder: Lab 02: Data Wrangling
4. Deleted all tabs from bottom of fishies_cleaned.xlsx except Spreadsheet Exercise.xlsx
5. Deleted Unknown column in data (there were no values in this column, just 0s)
6. I added “Notes” as the title to the AC column.
7. Under Month column (b) I changed all month words to values to match the rest of the data
   1. August and Auguts → 8
   2. July → 7
8. I right clicked Date column (column c) and clicked → format, this brought up a Format Cells window. I clicked Date in the Format pane, and selected Type *3/14/12. This made all dates inside of the column use the same formatting. 
9. Under Date column (column c) I right clicked → insert, a new column should appear to the left,  title the column “Day”.
   1. I had some issues with the Day formatting, so under the Number tab inside of the ribbon, I clicked on the dropdown and selected “Number”. Then the day showed as 26.00, which bothered my eyes so I clicked to decrease decimals (still under Number tab in the ribbon) until just 26 showed. 
10. Row 116 was missing important information, so this datapoint was deleted as it cannot be used in our dataset. 
11. I added a new column to the left of date titled DOY for Day of Year. 
   1. I entered this code into the cell: =E2-DATE(YEAR(E2),1,0)
   2. This will be useful for my data in the future, so I wanted to practice this now. 
12. I pressed “ctrl”+”f” and added a space, then clicked → find all. This finds all blank data in database. 
   1. Changed all  -99999 values to NA
   2. Then I repeated this step with nd data to NA
13. To replace all blanks inside the data frame, click → “ctrl”+”a” → “ctrl”+”g” (window should pop up) → special → blanks → type “NA” → hit “ctrl”+”enter”. 
   1. Control enter on the last step is important for filling all blank cells and not just one blank cell. 
14. I wanted to practice Data Validation, so I clicked → DOY column → Data Tab → under Data Tools inside the ribbon I clicked → Data Validation. 
   1. In the popup pane I selected Allow: Whole Number
   2. Min = 1
   3. Max = 365
      1. Then I practiced to see if it worked, it did!
15. Changing Column titles so R can handle them. Changed: 
   1. Depth → depth_fathoms
   2. Time towed to time_towed_min
   3. D1 → distance_towed_km
   4. DO → DO_mgperL
   5. Temp → temp_c
   6. Salinity → salinity_ppt
16. To ensure all values in data were number values and not formulas, I copied all data in data frame and pasted special as 123, numbers. 
17. File → Download → “CSV UTF-8” → stored into ESCI 502 folder under Lab02_fishies → fishies_cleaned.csv
18. Read file into R
